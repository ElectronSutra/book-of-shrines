# Wild shrines

- Hermit-shrines you find out in the wild of the Isle
- Some are infrequently attended-to, some are forgotten, some even have an
  installed hermit or someone who cares for it
- What do these mean for the people who live there?
- Memorializing "Great Places of the Dragons' Energy", demesnes, etc.; places of
  natural power or beauty which Immaculacy reveres as part of revering nature
