# Nomadic shrines

- Shrines that move on purpose
  - Shrines for nomadic populations that are still Immaculate
  - Specifically the "temple-backed monks" from the Rain game, who carry their
    collapsible shrines on their back to minister to the public directly
  - Shrines whose sacred space rotates in a set pattern vs. following a
    population
- Etc.
